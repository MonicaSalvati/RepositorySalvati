Delineate target users and stakeholders.
Set measurable goals and key performance indicators (KPIs).
Consider ethical implications and regulatory constraints.
Clear statement on prohibited uses or potential misuse scenarios.
Operational environment: Describe where and how the AI system will operate, such as on mobile devices, cloud platforms, or embedded system


What are the application functionalities? When possible  use the following items to structurate your answer:
Instructions for use for deployers: 
Model Capabilities:
    What the application can and cannot do (limitations).
    Supported languages, data types, or scenarios.
Input Data Requirements:
   Format and quality expectations for input data.
   Examples of valid and invalid inputs.
Output Explanation:

   Describe the key components of the system (including datasets, algorithms, models, etc.)


Using the following template, provide the required information about the project.
 
## Deployment
   
* Infrastructure and environment details (e.g., cloud setup, APIs).
* Integration with external systems or applications.
 
### Infrastructure and Environment Details
 
* **Cloud Setup**:
  * Specify cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) and regions.
  * List required services: compute (e.g., EC2, Kubernetes), storage (e.g., S3, Blob Storage), and databases (e.g., DynamoDB, Firestore).
  * Define resource configurations (e.g., VM sizes, GPU/TPU requirements).
  * Network setup: VPC, subnets, and security groups.
* **APIs**:
  * API endpoints, payload structure, authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, API keys).
  * Latency and scalability expectations.
